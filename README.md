# Folio

A small, fast, native macOS PDF reader that also opens Markdown. Swift + AppKit
+ PDFKit, no Electron, no storyboards; WebKit is used only offscreen, to typeset
Markdown into pages. Built because PDF Expert got slow.

- **Dark mode that inverts the page.** Follows the system appearance; in dark
  mode the PDF content itself renders light-on-dark, not just the window chrome.
  Toggle with View ▸ Invert Page Colors in Dark Mode, or force Light/Dark under
  View ▸ Appearance.
- **Adjustable window opacity, with a blurred backdrop.** View ▸ Window Opacity
  fades the page from 100% down to 30% so you can read against what is behind
  it, and blurs whatever shows through the way Terminal does; ⌥⌘↑ / ⌥⌘↓ step it,
  and View ▸ Blur Behind Window turns the blur off for a sharp backdrop.
- **Opens Markdown too.** A `.md` file is typeset into real pages and shown
  through the same reader, so tabs, dark mode, find, paging, and position memory
  all work on it. It re-renders within about half a second whenever the file
  changes on disk, keeping your place. The title bar shows its word count and
  reading time. Export the rendered pages with ⇧⌘E — always paginated, however
  you are reading it.
- **Markdown styles.** View ▸ Markdown ▸ Style offers six print-quality
  stylesheets — Manuscript (New York serif), Modern (SF, airy), GitHub,
  Antique (Baskerville, old-style numerals), Ink (small-caps heads, tight
  leading) and Academic (Times, indented paragraphs) — plus the body size.
  Drop a `.css` file into `~/Library/Application Support/Folio/Styles`
  (View ▸ Markdown ▸ Style ▸ Open Styles Folder…) and it joins the menu; it can
  set the stylesheet's variables (`--body-font`, `--line-height`, `--rule`, …)
  or override anything.
- **Pages or continuous.** View ▸ Markdown ▸ Pages / Continuous: real Letter
  pages, or one uninterrupted column with no page breaks at all.
- **One window, native tabs.** Every PDF opens as a tab (⌘T opens another,
  ⇧⌘[ / ⇧⌘] switch, drag tabs out to split).
- **Zippy.** Renders through PDFKit, the same engine as Preview. Launches cold in
  well under a second.
- **Remembers where you were** in each file.
- Arrow keys always page: ↑/← previous, ↓/→ next, ⌘↑/⌘↓ first/last.
- **Sidebar with a table of contents.** ⌃⌘S shows it; ⌥⌘2 and ⌥⌘3 switch
  between page thumbnails and the document's chapters. Markdown gets an outline
  too, synthesised from its headings, and the current entry follows you.
- Find with a hit counter and green highlights (⌘F,
  ⌘G / ⇧⌘G), go to page (⌥⌘G), zoom (⌘= / ⌘- / ⌘0 fit / ⌘1 actual),
  back/forward (⌘[ / ⌘]), print, export as PDF (⇧⌘E).

## Build

Requires Xcode (or the command-line tools with a Swift 5.9+ toolchain) on
macOS 14 or later, Apple Silicon only (the build is arm64; a universal binary would need `lipo` in `build.sh`).

```sh
./build.sh          # builds build/Folio.app
./build.sh --run    # builds and launches
./build.sh --debug  # debug configuration
```

Drag `build/Folio.app` to `/Applications` if you want it in Launchpad, then
right-click a PDF ▸ Get Info ▸ Open With to make it the default. For Markdown
there is a menu item: Folio ▸ Use Folio to Open Markdown Files.

Dependencies are Sparkle and [swift-markdown][], which is pinned by commit
because its own manifest depends on swift-cmark by branch and SwiftPM will not
accept a version range on top of that.

## How the dark-mode inversion works

The PDF view gets two Core Image filters on its layer: `CIColorInvert` followed
by a 180° `CIHueAdjust`. Together they flip luminance while preserving hue, so
white paper becomes black, black text becomes white, and blue links stay blue.
The GPU applies the filters at composite time, so there is no white flash while
tiles render, appearance changes are instant, and printing is untouched. The
thumbnail sidebar gets the same filters. Colors that must look right *after*
the filter (the page gutter, the green find highlights) are chosen pre-filter.

Find highlights in dark mode are drawn by `ReaderPage` (a `PDFPage` subclass)
with a `.screen` blend over each match, which recolors only the glyphs.

## How Markdown viewing works

A Markdown file is parsed with Apple's [swift-markdown][] and formatted to HTML,
then loaded into a `WKWebView` that lives in a window which is never shown. The
web view is printed to a temporary PDF with `NSPrintOperation`, and that
`PDFDocument` is handed to the normal reader. Nothing on screen is ever a web
view; WebKit is only the typesetter, and it is what gives us real page breaks,
selectable text, and clickable link annotations.

Two details matter. The print has to run through
`runModal(for:delegate:didRun:contextInfo:)` with `canSpawnSeparateThread` set:
WebKit computes its page range only on a secondary print thread, and
`NSPrintOperation.run()` never spawns one, which is the usual cause of blank
output. And margins come from `NSPrintInfo`, not from an `@page` rule, because
WebKit subtracts the print info's margins itself and setting both doubles them.

The stylesheet is two layers: a base layer of structure and CSS variables, and
a style layer that sets those variables — a built-in, or a `.css` file from
`~/Library/Application Support/Folio/Styles` used verbatim. Colours are picked
for how they look *after* the dark-mode inversion filter, which is a luminance
flip performed in linear light: code and table-header panels are near-white so
they come back as dark grays, and the page background must be pure white,
because even a faintly tinted paper comes back as a visible coloured slab.

Continuous layout is the same pipeline with a different page: the loaded
document is measured with `scrollHeight` and printed onto a single page as tall
as its content, with zero margins and the inch of white space supplied by
`body { padding }`. It is still an ordinary `PDFDocument`, so find, the
outline, and position memory need to know nothing about it.

## Icon

`Support/Folio.icon` is an Icon Composer package with light and dark
appearances, compiled by `scripts/make-icon.sh` into `Support/Assets.car`
(macOS 26 uses it via `CFBundleIconName`). The same script renders
`Support/Folio.icns` as the fallback for macOS 14 and 15.
`swift scripts/make-doc-icon.swift` builds `Support/MarkdownDocument.icns`,
the Finder document icon for `.md` files.
